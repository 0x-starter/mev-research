# Investigating Pair Trading Opportunities as a form of MEV on the Ethereum Network
## Background and Problem Statement
This research aims to explore and analyze the potential of pair trading as a means to capture MEV on the Ethereum mainnet. While the DeFi community has extensively examined atomic MEV opportunities, such as pure arbitrage and liquidations, statistical arbitrage based opportunities, excluding CEX-DEX arbitrage, have received little attention. This study seeks to address this gap by shedding light on the value extraction potential of pair trading.

In TradFi pair trading is an investment strategy which involves identifying two closely related assets and taking simultaneous long and short positions in them. This strategy aims to generate returns by exploiting price disparities between the two assets, regardless of the broader market’s direction. 

The research focuses on the following areas:
1. Identification and Quantification: Identify and quantify pair trading MEV opportunities that arise from price discrepancies in different trading pairs.
2. Characteristics analysis: Analyze how time sensitive pair trading opportunities are and how long price discrepancies last.
3. Analysis under Abnormal Market Conditions: Analyze how pair trading opportunities' characteristics differ under abnormal market conditions, such as distress caused by the collapse of a major exchange like FTX.

This research proposal aims to comprehensively analyze pair trading opportunities for MEV extraction on the Ethereum network. By investigating the nature and behavior of these opportunities, this study aims to enhance our understanding of MEV and establish a foundation for further research in statistical arbitrage based MEV.

## Plan and Deliverables

The research process plan will involve the following steps:

1. Literature Review: Conduct a concise literature review to establish a solid foundation for the research. This will involve reviewing relevant works on pair trading, MEV, and blockchain technology.
2. Data Gathering and Manipulation: Collect relevant data from Ethereum. Ensure the accuracy and relevance of the data and preprocess it to make it suitable for analysis.
3. Data Analysis and Methodology: Apply appropriate analysis techniques to the data to derive meaningful insights regarding pair trading based MEV opportunities. Clearly explain the methodology employed for analysis in the research paper.
4. Research Paper Refinement: Refine the structure, language, and clarity of explanations in the research paper. Ensure that the paper presents a cohesive narrative and effectively communicates the findings.
5. Feedback and Revision: Gather feedback from peers, mentors, and reviewers on the research paper. Make necessary revisions and improvements to address the feedback received. Finalize the research paper based on the suggested changes.
6. Blog Post: Write a concise and engaging blog post summarizing the research methodology and presenting the key results. The blog post should be accessible to a broader audience interested in the topic.

The estimated duration for the research process is expected to be between 6 and 10 weeks, with a maximum of 250 hours of active work. The deliverables of this research project will include:

- An academic research paper consisting of a literature review, methodology explanation, and detailed results.
- A blog post summarizing the research methodology and presenting key findings in a concise and accessible manner.
- Presentations of the research paper, showcasing its main components and results.

These deliverables will contribute to advancing knowledge in the field of statistical arbitrage based MEV and provide valuable insights for researchers, practitioners, and the broader blockchain community.
