**Summary:** 
</br> This is a survey of what the Flashbots architecture would look like on other chains and of other potential solutions to the negative externalities caused by MEV. We expect the Flashbots architecture to be general and allow for tx priority in all systems where there exists tx ordering.
This proposal is an effort to explore this thesis in more details as well as survey the other solutions to the problem we are tackling.

**Related Issues**
</br> 
* Hypothesis: architecture is general and will allow for priority in all systems
* Measure percent of hashpower / probability of success for PoW/PoS, leaderless protocols
* How does this differ in rollups with tx ordering auctions?
* What are alternative architectures and solutions?
  * Threshold decryption (for BFT)
