**Summary:** 
</br> This is an exploratory question where by no means we are looking for a definitive answer, rather to survey existing academic literature and think through the implications of what is being built.
Are we facilitating parasitic arbitrage and would it be better to have a system where MEV is not extracted maximally or where there isnâ€™t a lot of MEV.

**Motivation:**
</br> The ethical implications of the infrastructure we are building are not an afterthought and are at the forefront of our exploration.

**Proposed deliverable:**
* What is the state-of-the-art in discussions on parasitic vs helpful arbitrage?
* What are market designs that synergise with Flashbots / provide benefits to users other than arbers?
* Comparing various systems: high MEV+maximal extraction vs. low MEV + maximal extraction vs. no extraction @ L1
  * Does it make sense to prevent MEV at L1? Can you?
* Meta-game analysis: how should protocols design around MEV? should they negotiate w miners? encourage users?
* Minimizing MEV vs. Inevitable MEV? How much MEV can we minimize w app design and L1?

**Proposed Approach:**
</br> Surveying existing financial literature around parasitic arbitrage + market designs that synergise with Flashbots.
</br> Comparing various systems high MEV + max extraction, vs low MEV + max extraction etc
