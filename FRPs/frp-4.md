  * Discuss trade-offs in order type complexity vs. latency
* Permissionless: no KYC / ad-hoc trust required in design
  * Create security criteria for users not needing to trust miners/pools in PGA
  * Enumerate where current design falls short, implications of shortcomings


**Proposed Approach:**
