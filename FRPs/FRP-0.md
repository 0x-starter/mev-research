# FRPs

### What is an FRP?
FRPs stands for Flashbots Research Proposal. It is a markdown document describing the approach to answering a core Flashbots Research Question specified on the [Flashbots Research Roadmap (WIP)](research_roadmap.md). Similar to a research proposal for academic writing, it entails introducing what the research proposes to do and/or prove. It should incorporate systematic breakdown of the research question. It will also give an in-depth account of the methodologies, approaches or theories that will be used to support the hypothesis within the project, including a review of the relevant literature. 

### FRP workflow

**FRP Status Terms**
- **Draft:** the first formally tracked stage of an FRP in development. An FRP is merged by an FRP editor into the FRP repository when properly formatted. At this stage the draft may be iterating and undergoing rapid changes.
- **Review:** an FRP author marks an FRP as ready for and requesting peer review.
- **Accepted:** accepted FRPs are work in progress until incorporated into the research papers.
- **Withdrawn:** the FRP author(s) have withdrawn the proposed FRP. This state has finality and can no longer be resurrected using this EIP number. If the idea is pursued at later date it is considered a new proposal.
- **Completed:** the work associated with the FRP has been merged into Flashbots Research Paper and/or published independently, or otherwise deemed as completed by the FRP editors.
- **Stagnant:** an FRP in Draft or Accepted if inactive for a period of 6 months or greater is moved to stagnant. An FRP may be resurrected from this stage by Authors through moving it back to Draft, Withdrawn, or by FRP editors through moving it to Draft or Completed.

### What belongs in a successful FRP?
FRPs should be aligned with the general research questions listed in the [Research Roadmap](research_roadmap.md), and should articulate nicely with other successful FRPs. Each FRP is however unique, so tailored feedback will be provided on an individual basis. In terms of format, we encourage authors to follow the [FRP template](/FRP-template.md).
