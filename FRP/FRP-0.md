# FRPs

### What is an FRP?
FRPs stands for Flashbots Research Proposal. It is a markdown document describing the approach to answering a core Flashbots Research Question specified on the [Flashbots Research Roadmap (WIP)](research_roadmap.md). Similar to a research proposal for academic writing, it entails introducing what the research proposes to do and/or prove. It should incorporate systematic breakdown of the research question. It will also give an in-depth account of the methodologies, approaches or theories that will be used to support the hypothesis within the project, including a review of the relevant literature. 

### FRP workflow

**FRP Status Terms**
- **Draft:** the first formally tracked stage of an FRP in development. An FRP is merged by an FRP editor into the FRP repository when properly formatted. At this stage the draft may be iterating and undergoing rapid changes.
- **Review:** an FRP author marks an FRP as ready for and requesting peer review.
- **Accepted:** accepted FRPs are work in progress until incorporated into the research papers.
- **Withdrawn:** the FRP author(s) have withdrawn the proposed FRP. This state has finality and can no longer be resurrected using this EIP number. If the idea is pursued at later date it is considered a new proposal.
- **Completed:** the work associated with the FRP has been merged into Flashbots Research Paper and/or published independently, or otherwise deemed as completed by the FRP editors.
- **Stagnant:** an FRP in Draft or Accepted if inactive for a period of 6 months or greater is moved to stagnant. An FRP may be resurrected from this stage by Authors through moving it back to Draft, Withdrawn, or by FRP editors through moving it to Draft or Completed.

### What belongs in a successful FRP?
Each FRP is unique and depends on the nature of the research question, it can vary significantly in structure. However criteria for successful FRP are similar to that of an academic research proposal:

#### Part 1: Abstract or Summary
A 500 word paragraph that constitutes a simple straightforward statement of what your hypothesis is, what methodology you intend to use, what limitations those methods may have, what implications your results may have. 

#### Part 2: Defining the research question and/or hypothesis
Define the research questions and provide sufficient context or a systematic breakdown for understanding. Certain research questions can be formulate a testable, falsifiable claim through scientific methods.
It should link to related or dependent Research Question(s) on Flashbots Research Roadmap, and reference relevant Github Issues in this repo. 

#### Part 3: Literature Review
Some of the Research Questions requires literature review, some others are optional. However, it is strongly encouraged to incorporate a brief literature review, or at least a reference list of current relevant literature or past work pertaining to the Research Question.

#### Part 4: Artifacts / Deliverables / Outline
Depending on the type of research questions, list the artifacts or clear deliverables, or a proposed outline for the particular Research Question.
