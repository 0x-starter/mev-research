## Flashbots Research workshops

Research workshop is a 60-minute weekly discussion that addresses specific research questions, Flashbots Research Proposals (FRPs) and/or open questions within the scope specified in the [Flashbots Research Roadmap (WIP)](research_roadmap.md), so to set directions for resolving open issues or specific questions that arise from research-engineering coordination.

Anyone can propose a topic to be discussed in the Research Workshop by opening a github issue in Flashbots' [/mev-research repo](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-research/) and/or labeling an outstanding issue "workshop", and linking it to related FRPs and github issues or research questions yet to be addressed (Example: [Issue 24](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-research/issues/24) on MEV taxonomy). Research workshop will be recorded and published after the call.
