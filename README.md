# MEV-Research

Welcome! In this repo, you can **suggest an edit to any parts of a FRQ, contribute to an open issue related to one of the FRQs or open your own issue relevant to one of the FRQs**  

Our FRP teams are coordinated by our Research Fellows, who will be reviewing your edit suggestions, respond to your comments and on-board you as a research contributor should you mutually like working together. 

**What is a Research Fellow?**
</br> A Research Fellow is part of our core research team and explores research directions. Learn more about becoming a Research Fellow here.

**What is a FRQ?**
</br> FRQ stands for Flashbots Research Question. An FRQ is a document proposing a new research question to the Flashbots research community. Each FRQ is broken down into chunks linked in the FRQ as issues.

We intend Flashbots to be an open research organization where FRQs and the underlying issues they generate are the primary mechanism for anyone in the ecosystem to suggest and contribute to research.

**Bootstrapping FRPs**
</br> Initially, we are a lean and fast-moving organization with clear short-term research goals. With that in mind, we have submitted 8 FRQs which are core to our research efforts in the next months. FRQs will be open for community submissions in early 2021, until then we’d like to collaborate with the community on our existing FRQs and their related issues.

* FRQ-1:
* FRQ-2:
* FRQ-3:
* FRQ-4:
* FRQ-5:
* FRQ-6:
* FRQ-7:
* FRQ-8:
* FRQ-9:


**Current Asks:**
</br> Comment on an existing FRP by submitting an edit to it through a pull request or by creating an issue in the Research repo to open a discussion on a particular point of the FRP.

**Authorship**
</br> Our research efforts will output research papers that will be shaped by Research Fellows. Anyone (including entities) can be an author of these papers as long as they meet one of the criteria for authorship we follow, as described in the Association for Computing Machinery's [Criteria for Authorship](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/authorship).
