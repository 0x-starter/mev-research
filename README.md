# Flashbots Research

## Spirit

Flashbots is a research and development organization focused on the impact of MEV has on state-rich blockchains such as Ethereum. MEV (Maximal Extractable Value) is a complex topic at the cutting edge of cryptocurrency research that entails many (fascinating) interwoven disciplines, stakeholders and tradeoffs. As such, research is essential to our organization's existence.

Our research and development operate hand in hand, and have been designed to closely feed into each-other forming a dual engine that propels Flashbots forward. Aligned with the rest of our organization's values, all our research efforts are accessible to the public, open to anyone to contribute to and highly collaborative with the community.

MEV is a pervasive issue to all decentralized systems. We are building Flashbots Research as a research hub for MEV, tackling and uncovering questions relevant to the short, medium and long-term future of the industry. We view this research as essential to help the cryptocurrency industry better understand and deal with MEV. We are currently funded through venture capital but aim to build a sustainable self-funded independent research organization that can become a place where ambitious researchers can work amongst like-minded individuals on the most interesting research questions unencumbered from the traditional friction of academia.

## Research Topics
Flashbots research covers a wide array of topics centered about the MEV theme. Several of these topics are directly related to our auction system and are meant as initial explorations around problems that will eventually need to be solved for our project to ultimately succeed. Other topics are more loosely related, and are part of our wider effort to illuminate the MEV landscape to provide a more level playing field for all actors involved.

A list of the research topics we are either currently working on, or on which we would like to advance our knowlegde can be found [here](topics.md).

## Community
The Flashbots Research community is fully virtual. You can interact with it in several ways:
* join us on Flashbots' Discord #research channel for synchronous conversations with the Flashbots community
* open an issue on this repository (eg.) for asynchronous conversations on an MEV-related topics
* join our weekly research workshops by subscribing to the Flashbots Research calendar
* join our monthly MEV-Roasts where we present new ideas and get roasted by the community
* ad-hoc events such as research-a-thons

We regularly collaborate with other research organizations. This can take many shapes such as a joint series of research workshops, a cross-organization team formation to work on a specific research question, or a joint grant program for questions that matter to both organizations. We encourage you to reach out if you'd like to discuss a collaboration.

## Join us
While we see all our community members as part of Flashbots Research, there exists multiple ways to be more deeply involved in the organization. We are actively recruiting for full-time research positions such as a research data engineer and a research prototype engineer. Check out the full job descriptions [here]().

Another way is to become a Flashbots Research grant recipient by submitting a Flashbots Research Proposal and working alongside the full-time team at Flashbots and your collaborators in leading the exploration of a question of your choice. Flashbots Research Proposals (FRPs) are research proposals submitted as pull requests on this repository and reviewed by a 3-person commitee composed of Alejo Salles, Alex Obadia and Phil Daian. Upon discussion with the submitter and a review of the proposal, and within a maximum of 2 weeks from the latest submission, the submitter is informed whether their proposal will be funded.
